**A decentralized peer-to-peer network for deploying and accessing AI models.**

ConnectIT allows you to run a node that serves Hugging Face models to the network, or act as a client that automatically discovers and uses the cheapest and fastest model providers available. It features an integrated Supervisor Mode for health monitoring.

## ✨ Features

- 🌐 **Dynamic P2P Network**: Automatically detects your LAN IP and assigns random ports for zero-config setup.
- 👁️ **Supervisor Monitoring**: The API node acts as a "Main Point" that actively monitors peer health (latency, availability) every 60s.
- 🤖 **Async Model Loading**: Loading large models doesn't block the network causing disconnects.
- 💰 **Economic Model**: Set your price per token. Clients automatically route to the best value.
- 🔌 **HTTP API**: REST API to query network status, peers, and health stats.

## 📦 Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/loayabdalslam/connectit.chatit.git
cd connectit

# Install with all dependencies
pip install -e .[all]
```

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Start a Supervisor Node (Main Point)

This node will act as the bootstrap server and actively monitor the health of all connected peers.

```bash
# Start on default API port 8000. P2P port can be 4001 or random.
python -m connectit api
```
*The console will show "Supervisor Monitoring Enabled". Check `http://localhost:8000/peers` for health stats.*

### 2. Deploy a Model Provider

Nodes deploy services and join the network. They will be monitored by the Supervisor.

```bash
# Replace bootstrap-link with the Supervisor's link
python -m connectit deploy-hf --model distilgpt2 --bootstrap-link ws://192.168.1.X:4001
```

### 3. Request Generation

```bash
python -m connectit p2p-request "Hello, world!" --model distilgpt2 --bootstrap-link ws://192.168.1.X:4001
```

## 🏗 Architecture

### Supervisor / Main Point
When you run `connectit api`, the node starts a background task (`_monitoring_loop`) that iterates over all connected peers every minute.
-   **Ping**: Sends distinct ping packets to measure RTT.
-   **Health Audit**: Updates the peer's `health_status` (online/degraded) based on connectivity.
-   **API Exposure**: This data is available at `/peers`.

### Core Components
1.  **P2PNode (`p2p_runtime.py`)**: Core engine with gossip, dynamic IP, and monitoring logic.
2.  **Services (`services.py`)**: threaded model loading for stability.
3.  **API (`api.py`)**: FastAPI interface to the node and supervisor stats.
